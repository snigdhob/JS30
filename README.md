# JS30

This is my take on the famous JavaScript30 course by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos). Course link:  https://javascript30.com/

## Challenges

### Day 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

So I went ahead and made the following enhancements:

- Added a click trigger to each key.
- When the user enters a particular sequence while playing(read **SAD**), the drum kit gets locked automatically. Tapping on any key in this locked state will not emit any sound, just a red border will be displayed for the pressed key.
- On entering the unlock code(read **ASK**), the user can resume playback normally.
- Responsive design.

### Day 02 - JS & CSS Clock

Honestly, I had a great time making this and this far more challenging than I initially imagined. [WebDevSimplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified)'s tutorial was a big help and the end prduct seems to be quite satisfactory.

Enhancements:

- Added numbers to the clock face.
- Fixed the skipping animation bug when a new cycle starts.
- Added a timezone feature (Moment.js to the rescue!).
- Incorporated the ticking sound of a real life clock.
