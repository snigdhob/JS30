# JS30

This is my take on the famous JavaScript30 course by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos). Course link:  https://javascript30.com/

## Challenges

### Day 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

So I went ahead and made the following enhancements:

- Added a click trigger to each key.
- When the user enters a particular sequence while playing(read **SAD**), the drum kit gets locked automatically. Tapping on any key in this locked state will not emit any sound, just a red border will be displayed for the pressed key.
- On entering the unlock code(read **ASK**), the user can resume playback normally.
- Responsive design.
